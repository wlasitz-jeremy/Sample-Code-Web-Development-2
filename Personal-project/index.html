      <h4>Depth and Pressure</h4>
      <p>
        Underwater, you're under more pressure because water also has weight,
        which combines with the atmosphere's weight(pressure). Since water has
        more density and is heavier than air 10 meters/33 feet exerts the same
        pressure as the whole atmosphere. Therefore, the pressure increases by
        one bar/ata for each 10 meters /33 feet you descend (go down). Likewise,
        the pressure decreases by one bar/ata for every 10 meters/33 feet you
        ascend (go up).
      </p>
      <h4 class="Pressure,volume and density">
        Pressure, Air Volume and Density
      </h4>
      <p>
        Water can not be compressed so its volume and density do not change with
        pressure changes. Since your body tissues are mostly made of water, you
        do not feel the pressure changes on most of your body while diving.
        Pressure changes do change the volume and density of air (or any other
        gas). As the pressure increases - as you go deeper - a gas volume
        decreases because the gas molecules get compressed. The gas density
        increases because all the molecules are there, but they're packed into a
        smaller area. This affects all the air spaces in, or in contact with,
        your body. These include your ears, sinuses, lungs, mask, and when using
        one, a dry suit. You'll also learn that this principal affects
        controlling your buoyancy, how long your air supply lasts, and some
        important safety rules. Air volume and density change proportionately
        with pressure. This means if you go from the surface to 10 meters/33
        feet, you double the pressure to 2 bar/ata(1 air plus 1 water), a given
        air volume halves, and its density doubles. If you go to 20 meters/66
        feet, the pressure is 3 bar/ata(1 air plus 2 water). An air volume would
        be one-third the surface volume, and density would be triple.
      </p>
      <h3>-Being a Diver 2-</h3>
      <h4>Seeing and Hearing as a Diver</h4>
      <p>
        Let's investigate how being underwater affects how you see and hear.
      </p>
      <h4>Apparent size and Distance</h4>
      <p>
        Water is about 800 times denser than air, which causes many of the
        differences between the terrestrial and aquatic worlds. One effect of
        this is that it causes light to change direction slightly (refract) when
        it transfers from water into the air in your mask. This direction change
        magnifies objects by about a third. Depending on your perspective
        objects look larger, closer, or both than they really are. you may reach
        for something and miss because it's farther away than it appears. With
        experience, you learn to compensate unconsciously.
      </p>
      <h4>Color Loss and Scattering</h4>
      <p>
        Water also affects light by reflecting, scattering and absorbing it.
        This means that as you go deeper, it gets darker. During the day, at the
        most popular dive sites you usually have adequate light. On most dives,
        it does not seem dark at all, though on others, like night dives or when
        the visibility is poor, it obviously does. In these conditions, you can
        use a dive light - you'll get to do this during the Night Adventure Dive
        in the PADI Open Water Diver Course. Water also absorbs light directly,
        but not uniformly. As light travels through it, water absorbs some
        colors before others. The farther light travels through water, the more
        color it loses. As you go deeper, red is the first color absorbed,
        followed by orange, yellow, green, and finally blue. You see the same
        color lose when looking at distant objects. Distant objects tend to
        become more colorful as you get closer. Your eyes adjust somewhat for
        the color change, but shinning a light at depth brings back lost color
        and shows the difference.
      </p>
      <h4>Hearing Underwater</h4>
      <p>
        Water affects what you hear underwater, because it transmits sound more
        efficiently than does air. You will hear many new sounds from aquatic
        life, boats, divers, and other sources. Underwater sound travels over
        long distances. For example, a boat that you can not hear at the surface
        may sound relatively close underwater. Sound travels about four times
        faster in water than in air. This makes it difficult to determine its
        source - underwater, it usually seems like sound is coming form all
        around, or directly overhead. You may be able to tell relative change in
        distance by a sound growing louder or fainter, even though you can not
        tell the direction.
      </p>
      <h3>-Being a Diver 3-</h3>
      <h4>Dive environments and Conditions</h4>
      <p>
        Part of dive planning includes recognizing what to expect in different
        dive environments and how conditions can affect dive plans.
      </p>
      <h4>Types of Dive Environments</h4>
      <p>
        The reason diving is so popular all over the world is because you can
        enjoy it in many different environments, each with their own
        characteristics. Common popular environments include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>coral reefs</li>
        <li>lakes and reservoirs</li>
        <li>rivers</li>
        <li>springs</li>
        <li>flooded quarries</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In these environments, six general conditions can affect you. The degree
        to which condition varies and affects you depends on the environment.
        Some environments have little temperature change, whereas others have
        significant changes. Some places never have water movement, others
        always do and yet others may or may not, depending upon different
        factors. The six general conditions are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>temperature</li>
        <li>visibility</li>
        <li>water movement</li>
        <li>bottom composition</li>
        <li>aquatic life</li>
        <li>sunlight</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Temperature</h4>
      <p>
        Diving takes place in water as cool as near freezing(-2 degrees
        Celsius/28 Fahrenheit) to (30 degree Celsius/85 Fahrenheit). Most diving
        takes place in water on the warm end of this range, but thanks to modern
        exposure suits, often in water cooler than we would otherwise be
        comfortable.
      </p>
      <h4>Visibility</h4>
      <p>
        Visibility underwater ranges from 0 meters to more than 60 meters/200
        feet and influences your dive significantly. You want to learn how to
        adjust your dive based to visibility, how to keep from reducing your
        visibility by your actions and when visibility is too poor to dive. You
        measure visibility as the distance you can see horizontally underwater.
        This can be subjective - you may be able recognize the silhouette of a
        diver 12 meters/40 feet away, and some would call this 12 meter/40 foot
        visibility. Others would use a shorter distance at which they can make
        out the details.
      </p>
      <h4>Water Movement</h4>
      <p>
        Two types of water motion primarily affect you while diving: waves and
        currents. Waves result primarily from wind blowing over the waters
        surface. The stronger the wind and the larger the distance it passes
        over, the larger the wave can grow. Waves affect swimming at the
        surface, as well as the techniques you use entering and exiting the
        water. Currents result from waves, water heating and cooling, the
        earth's rotation and tides. Those caused by waves vary with wind
        direction. Due to water rising or sinking as it heats or cools,
        respectively, currents are created that tend to be seasonal. Although
        such water motion is initially vertical, when it reaches the bottom or
        an obstacle, the flow can continue horizontally. Major oceanic currents
        and counter-currents result from earth's rotation. Although these
        permanent currents, their paths and strength vary to a degree due to
        other influences. Tides, which result from the gravitational pull of the
        sun and moon, lift the oceans and cause water levels to rise and fall as
        the earth rotates.
      </p>
      <h4>Bottom Composition</h4>
      <p>
        You can divide the different bottom composition into five basic types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Silt/Mud</strong> - Clay, fine organic/inorganic material or
          mud
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sand</strong> - Larger, coarser particles</li>
        <li><strong>Rock</strong> - Gravel and large rock</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coral</strong> - Living and dead coral in tropical water
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vegetation</strong> - Various plants and algae found in both
          fresh and salt water
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contact tends to reduce visibility. So, avoiding contact keeps the water
        clearer. In environments like coral or rock, you can get cuts or scrapes
        if you're not careful. Bottom contact also has risks of stings or
        punctures from organisms like hydroids or sea urchins. Vegetation
        bottoms like kelp might have some entanglement risks. Aquatic life on
        the bottom is fragile and sensitive. Resting or kneeling on them, or
        kicking them with your fin tips, can injure or destroy them. Staying off
        the bottom helps preserve the site's natural beauty.
      </p>
      <h3>-Being a Diver 4-</h3>
      <h4>Health and Fitness</h4>
      <p>
        Diving is relaxing and you try to dive relaxed, but it is not always
        slow moving, even if you plan it to be, so you need to be in good health
        and reasonably fit. Strenuous activity can arise, including handling
        gear, currents, an emergency or unanticipated physical demand.
      </p>
      <h3>-Being a Diver 5-</h3>
      <h4>Gas Narcosis</h4>
      <p>
        Gas narcosis is not thought to be harmful itself. The hazard is that it
        impairs the good judgement, clear thinking and timely responses you need
        to avoid and manage problems underwater.
      </p>
      <h4>Causes and Effects</h4>
      <p>
        Gas narcosis is thought to be caused by increased dissolved gasses in
        the body tissues slowing nerve impulses that travel in the brain and
        nervous system. It slows the communication between the brain and the
        body, and between different parts of the brain. Breathing air most
        drivers notice narcosis at approximately 30 meters/100 feet. Narcosis
        differs, however, from individual to individual and in the same diver
        from one to the next. Being tired, dehydrated or generally fatigued may
        make narcosis noticeable shallower, and some prescription and
        over-the-counter-drugs combine their effects with narcosis, making
        intoxication stronger. Cool water, darkness, and limited visibility seem
        to increase narcosis, though it may be that added stress simply makes
        the effects more noticeable. Diving experience seems to reduce narcosis
        - but pyscologists think you learn to compensate for it.
      </p>
      <h4>Avoiding and Managing Gas Narcosis</h4>
      <p>
        You avoid gas narcosis by not diving too deep. For the most part people,
        assuming no predisposing factors, gas narcosis isn't likely to be a
        concern diving as deep as 30 meters/100 feet. If you experience
        narcosis, immediately ascend to a shallower depth. Generally, narcosis
        fades quickly.

      <h2>*Equipment*</h2>
      <h3>-Equipment 1-</h3>
      <h4>Primary Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        The three most important considerations when choosing scuba gear are
        <em>sustainability, fit, </em>and <em>comfort.</em><br /><br /><strong
          >Sustainability</strong
        >
        means the equipment is appropriate for you and the dive. If planning a
        dive in cool water, your short sleeve wet suit - perfectly suitable for
        tropical diving - may not be suitable.<br /><br /><strong>Fit</strong>
        means the equipment is sized and adjusted for you. Many pieces of gear
        will not function, or function poorly, if they do not fit properly. Your
        PADI dive shop and instructor will help you learn to select gear that
        fits and adjust it.<br /><br /><strong>Comfort</strong> means you can
        wear the item for an hour or more without a significant distraction due
        to its feel or configuration. Uncomfortable equipment that annoys you
        can take the fun out of a dive. It can sometimes distract you from
        safety issues. Be sure you gear fits and it's comfortable. To a point, a
        professional can tell if something fits, but you have to say whether it
        is or is not comfortable.
      </p>
      <h4>Secondary Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        Once your gear is suitable, comfortable and fits, there are four
        secondary considerations: cost and features, servicability, color and
        style, and accessories.<br /><br /><strong>Cost and features</strong> -
        You can choose gear from a price range, with more comfortable features
        on high-end models.<br /><br /><strong>Serviceability</strong> -
        Consider that some equipment requires annual or biannual professional
        servicing. Most dive operations service the brands they sell, so getting
        gear from your PADI dive shop typically covers this.<br /><br /><strong
          >Color and Style</strong
        >
        - You can choose gear that looks good and is color coordinated.<br /><br /><strong
          >Accessories</strong
        >
        - For each piece of equipment, your local PADI Professional can suggest
        related accessories. A professional at your dive shop may, for example,
        suggest retainers that hold equipment where it belongs, or an
        appropriate mask defog so you can see clearly. These contribute
        <em>significantly</em> to diving comfort and convenience. Do not neglect
        useful accessories.
      </p>
      <h3>-Equipment 2-</h3>
      <h4>Exposure Suits</h4>
      <p>
        You wear an exposure suit on most dives for two main reasons: warmth,
        and or protection against accidental stings, abrasions, or cuts. There
        are three primary suit types: wet suits, dry suits and skin suits.
      </p>
      <h5>Wet Suits</h5>
      <p>
        Wet suits are the most common type of exposure suit. This is because
        they provide insulation and protection and also come in a wide variety
        of styles depending upon how much insulation you need. This makes them
        useful in water as cold as (10 degrees Celsius/50 degrees Fahrenheit) to
        as warm as (30 degrees Celsius/86 degrees Fahrenheit). Wet suits
        insulate you with foam neoprene (or other insulating materials), but you
        don't stay dry. Water seeps into the suit around your waist, ankles and
        neck and gets trapped. Your body heat quickly heats the trapped water,
        and the neoprene greatly slows heat loss. To work, though, the suit must
        trap water. If your suit is too loose, it will let water in too easily
        and not trap enough heat to provide insulation. If your suit is too
        tight, it will be uncomfortable and may restrict movement or breathing.
      </p>
      <h5>Dry Suits</h5>
      <p>
        Dry suits provide the most insulation. They have specific water-tight
        zippers and seals, and most types cover your entire body, except for
        your head and hands, which you protect with a wet suit hood and gloves.
        Dry suits used in the coldest waters (under polar ice) keep even your
        extremities warm. The air within the suit is heated by your body heat,
        and the suit's design prevents water from entering. This makes dry suits
        ideal for cold water diving. They extend your diving time in cold water
        and are essential for diving in polar regions, where water temperature
        is cooler than 10 degrees Celsius/50 degrees Fahrenheit. Dry suits
        create an air space around your body that provides insulation, but it
        also makes you more buoyant. You need to add air to the suit as you
        descend to prevent it from squeezing you, and release air as you ascend
        to prevent it from over-inflating. This requires some practice, but your
        PADI instructor will teach you how to do this during the Dry Suit
        Adventure Dive in the PADI Open Water Diver Course. Dry suits are more
        expensive than wet suits, and they require more maintenance. They also
        require more training to use properly, so you need to be a certified
        diver before you can take the Dry Suit Adventure Dive.
      </p>
      <h5>Skin Suits</h5>
      <p>
        Skin suits are thin, form-fitting suits made of synthetic materials like
        Lycra or nylon. They are typically worn over a swimsuit or under a wet
        suit to provide additional protection against cuts, scrapes, and stings.
        Skin suits are lightweight and don't provide insulation like wet or dry
        suits, but they do offer protection in environments where you might
        encounter sharp coral, rocks, or marine life. They are often used in
        warm water diving or as a base layer under a wet suit in cooler
        conditions. Skin suits are also popular for activities like snorkeling
        or freediving where thermal protection is not a concern but protection
        from the sun and marine life is desired.
      </p>
      <h3>-Equipment 3-</h3>
      <h4>Surface Signalling Devices</h4>
      <p>
        Typically, you should have at-least two surface signalling devices with
        you on a dive. Of the two devices, you should have an audible device
        that allows you to attract attention with sound, and a visual device
        that makes you easier to see at a distance, especially amid waves. In an
        emergency you may use both - the audible signal to alert help from the
        boat or shore, and the visual signal so responders can see where you
        are. Divers commonly use the following devices, from which you'll choose
        two or more:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whistles can normally attach to your BCD inflator</li>
        <li>
          Low-pressure horns use air from your cylinder and are louder than
          whistles
        </li>
        <li>
          Inflatable signal tubes are brightly colored plastic or fabric tubes
          that inflate at the surface. They stand roughly 1 meter/3 feet above
          the surface, helping make you visible in rough conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Signal mirrors allow you to reflect sunlight to attract attention
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>-Equipment 4-</h3>
      <h4>Mesh utility Bag</h4>
      <p>
        Besides your gear bag, you want on or more mesh utility bags. A mesh
        utility bag is a heavy-duty bag made from nylon mesh (so it drains) or
        other water-resistant synthetic.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Style - Some bags are all mesh with a drawstring closure. Others have
          wire or plastic frames that allow you to hold them with one hand open
          and locked closed
        </li>
        <li>
          Material - Many mesh utility bags are entirely mesh. Others have an
          upper portion that is solid, so they last longer
        </li>
        <li>
          Size - Mesh bags range from hand size to large enough to hold almost
          all your gear
        </li>
        <li>
          Straps or Handles - Larger mesh bags, especially those intended for
          carrying gear, usually have straps or handles
        </li>
      </ul>
